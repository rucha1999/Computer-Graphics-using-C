# Computer-Graphics-using-C

Performed Graphical representation of City-Scenery using C

Introduction:

Computer graphics are pictures and films created using computers. Usually, the term refers to computer-generated image data created with the help of specialized graphical hardware and software. It is a vast and recently developed area of computer science.
Our project basically works on the concept of Transformation of an object, Transformation are needed to manipulate the initially created object and to display the modified object without having to redraw it.

There are various Transformation operations in computer graphics and they are:
1.	Transformation
2.	Rotation
3.	Scaling
4.	Reflection
5.	Shear
   
The concept which we are implementing is translation.
-	A Translation moves all points in an object along the same straight line path to new position.
-	The path is represented by a vector, Called the translation or shift vector.
-	We can write the components :
P’x = Px + Tx

P’y = Py + Ty
-	Or in  matrix form:
P’ = P + T

Translation:

The x co-ordinate of cycle ,car & helicopter are given as line(a+x,b,c+x,d). Here, x will be incremented using for loop after each step for moving the whole object. This is the at initial stage at x = 0
